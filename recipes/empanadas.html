        <p><h4>September is coming and you can't miss empanadas</h4></p>
        <p>My mother is from Chile and empanadas have been a staple in our household for years. I have searched and searched and never seem to find the right one, so here is our family-favorite recipe for Chilean empanadas. My mom likes to sprinkle sugar on hers, 
            while I prefer to dip mine in a little mustard — we all have our own cravings! This recipe makes about a dozen large empanadas, depending on the size.</p>

            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cornstarch</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong>Dough:</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup lukewarm milk</li>
            <li>1 cup shortening, melted</li>
            <li>5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1:</strong></li>Make the filling: Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, oregano, cumin, salt, and pepper; 
            cook and stir until onion is golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Add pork and cook until completely browned and crumbly, 7 to 10 minutes more. 
            Drain fat from the skillet. Stir in raisins, olives, and hard-cooked eggs.
            <li><strong>Step 2:</strong></li>Whisk water and cornstarch together in a small bowl; pour into the skillet and stir until liquid thickens. 
            Remove from the heat and set aside.
            <li><strong>Step 3:</strong></li>Make the dough: Whisk milk and melted shortening together in a bowl until evenly blended. 
            Stir flour and salt together in a separate large bowl. Pour milk mixture into flour mixture; whisk until well combined and a dough forms. Let rest for 10 minutes.
            <li><strong>Step 4:</strong></li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
            <li><strong>Step 5:</strong></li>Roll dough on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of 1/8 inch. Cut into 12 circles with a round cookie cutter or glass. 
            Spoon filling into the center of each circle. Fold each circle in half and press the edges with a fork to seal. Brush the tops with beaten egg. 
            Place empanadas onto the prepared baking sheet.
            <li><strong>Step 6:</strong></li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 25 minutes.
        </ol>
